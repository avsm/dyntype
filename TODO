- create indexes
- foreign keys (Frefs)
- no delete
- no fold
- let type t work via type alias (clashes with Functor atm)
- custom triggers
- sig generator
- ocamldoc
- better error message with incorrect foreign type (currently failwith
- updates fail when record is all lists (and hence no non-foreign), need check
