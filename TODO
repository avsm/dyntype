- create indexes
- foreign keys (Frefs)
- no delete
- no fold
- let type t work via type alias (clashes with Functor atm)
- custom triggers
- sig generator
- ocamldoc
- better error message with incorrect foreign type (currently failwith
- type v = One of int*int fails, unless it is written as (int * int)
- type constrain the polymorphic search  methods, since they are a bit crazy atm
